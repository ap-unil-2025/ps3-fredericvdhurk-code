Introduction to Data Science and Advanced Programming, HEC Lausanne, Fall Semster 2025

Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.
This advanced course introduces students to the Python programming language, core concepts of statistical learning, and high-performance computing. It is designed for Master’s students in Economics and Finance to build the computational and analytical skills necessary for modern quantitative analysis.

The course consists of three 45-minute lecture sessions and one 45-minute hands-on session each week.

It is offered at HEC Lausanne during the Fall Semester 2025 (Monday, September 15 - Monday, December 15, 2025).

Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
Manipulate and analyze data using NumPy and Pandas.
Create insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Understand the fundamental theory of statistical learning, including the bias–variance trade-off and model assessment.
Implement and evaluate machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering using scikit-learn.
Use tree-based methods and ensemble learning.
Gain awareness of deep learning concepts and implement a simple neural network.
Apply basic high-performance computing (HPC) techniques to accelerate Python code.
Independently manage and execute a data science project from conception to presentation.
Meeting time and location

Time: Mondays, 12:30–16:00
Place: Internef 263
TA sessions: Weekly on Mondays (15:15–16:00) with Anna Smirnova, Francesco Brunamonti, and Zhongshan Chen. Individual TA sessions available on Fridays upon request.

The Programmer's Journey

Grading

Every student has to provide a capstone project that illustrates what was learned.
Each student individually has to propose a data science project and work on it over the course of the semester.
The due date to submit the project is in the last week of the semester.
The deliverables are:
i) a report of about 10 pages lengths.
ii) a GitHub repository with the related code and data.
iii) a video recording of a maximum of 10 minutes length that presents the project, the findings, etc.
We will award the grades based on whether the capstone project demonstrates an understanding of the material. There will be no exams.
There will be possibilities to collect ``bonus points'' via homework assignments.
